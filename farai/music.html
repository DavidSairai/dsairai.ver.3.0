Now this is where we start talking. I am a huge fan of RnB, rap, hiphop, dancehall ragga, trance, rave. I love fast moving beat as it it makes alert all the time. Just listening to songs from CNN, Nas, Jay-Z, Foxy Brown, Eve, Capleton, Elephant Man, etc makes me flow. Yebo peeps, life is short but one must make it sweet and enjoyable.
<p>My taste is quite varied. I got like over 7GB of mp3 on my personal computer @ home. And that is still rising.
