Have you ever wondered how you can get free music?!! When I say free, I mean really, really free music from the net. You can use <a href="http://napster.com" onMouseover="window.status='Sorry Folks. this service is now kinda extinct';return true" onMouseout="window.status='Welcome To David Home Site'">Napster</a> although a lot of the mp3 files have been blocked. Just download it direct from their web site, register yourself and you are in. But you are running out of time. You can get any song you have always dreamed of! Well sort of anyway. But since March/April, Napster has blocked all the mp3's on it's service. @ the moment, Napster is in the process of implementing a new service which is subscription based, ie <b>YOU</b> have to start paying!!!
<p><a href="http://www.imesh.com" onMouseover="window.status='Another Web based mp3 transfer service';return true" onMouseout="window.status='Welcome To David Home Site'">iMesh</a> is also quite good but not as good as Napster though. Just make sure you don't restrict others from getting yo <a href="http://mp3.com" onMouseover="window.status='Check out the infor about new mp3s';return true" onMouseout="window.status='Welcome To David Home Site'">MP3's</a> or you will make this facility a mess. You have got to download the Napster and the iMesh program for you to actually start using the sharing facility offered by the sites.
<p>The best program I have used to date is <a href="http://audiogalaxy.com" onMouseover="window.status='My favourite mp3 search service';return true" onMouseout="window.status='Welcome To David Home Site'">Audio Galaxy</a>. This program is web based and the registration is just like Napaster. This service is not restricted to mp3 only but you can also search for other files. This is basically a file sharing service and lets you resume your mp3 downloads, just as if your are using <a href="http://gozilla.com" onMouseover="window.status='Get you downloads without any fuss';return true" onMouseout="window.status='Welcome To David Home Site'">Go!Zilla</a>. I have also just discovered <a href="http://musiccity.com" onMouseover="window.status='Another good mp3 service';return true" onMouseout="window.status='Welcome To David Home Site'">Music City</a> which is more like Audio Galaxy. <a href="http://wego.gutelliums.com/windows" onMouseover="window.status='Get your own file sharing program';return true" onMouseout="window.status='Welcome To David Home Site'">Gnutella</a> is a service which has been around for a while. This sprang up from the Linux community. Check out the different file sharing programs you can use. My best bet would be <a href="http://bearshare.com">Bearshare</a> and <a href="http://limewire.com">Limewire</a> which have passed my test for downloading mp3s.
