My graft is not all that. I am a System Administrator for a local manufacturing company. I basically over seer the running of the computer network and the computer hardware and software associated with it. This includes the maintenance of the network, hardware, software and help the users out. I also plan the way forward in the I.T. Department for the company . The company had it's first web site up and running in June 2000. Right now I am in the process of updating it so that we have a "fresh" look for the web site.
<p>The company has about 20 plus computers running on Windows 98. The server has a Celeron Intel 400MHz, a 100Mb network card, a 9GB Seagate SCSI hard drive, a Mylex Raid Plus SCSI adapter, a Seagate 1/4" tape drive(for backups), Windows NT 4.0 (SP6), Wingate 4 Proffessional for Internet and E-Mail access, Pastel 5, Norton Antivirus Corporate, and a 40X CDROM drive. The computers are used in the accounts department where Pastel 5 is the accounting package being used. When I started working for the company, Tetra 2000 was the accounting package being used but due to poor support form the suppliers, I managed to convince the management to change over to Pastel which I must say is truly amazing. The support and training we got from our local support guys has been superb. We intially had problems with the network because of the cheap Accton ethernet hubs which were linking the 20 odd computers. Not only that, the UTP cables were now old and in someplaces of the UTP cable, one could actually see the naked wires. I then set out to get some new UTP cable, RJ45 plugs and boots, an RJ45 crimping tool, two 8 port Compex 10/100Mb hubs and a <a href="http://www.3com.com/products/en_US/detail.jsp?pathtype=purchase&tab=features&sku=3C16751B-US">16 port 3com Office Connect Dual Speed</a> hub. I then had a new server bought with Windows NT4 installed. Unfortunately <a href="http://www.pastel.com">Pastel</a> only runs on windows platform. I really wanted to try Linux because that's my OS. Anyway, I had the cabling for the whole network redone, setup the hubs and server, all in 3 days!!
<p>We had few problems initially after the changeover. Only user problems continued to irk me because they would for instance press the reset button if the computer hung(typical in windows) or when the power went out. The power problem was solved when i managed to acquire 300 VA APC UPS units for each computer. The hubs were not left out as they formed part of the network. So if the power went out everywhere else in the building, my network would still be running on the UPS units. As the UPS units can only supply upto about 10 minutes of power, I told all the users that they had to switch of their computers as soon as the power went out so as not to drain the UPS batteries.
<p>Th web site I have designed for the company took me almost 2 months. It was done together with another workmate. We are currently considering to introduce e-commerce services on our web site to give our customers the opportunity to order goods and maybe, in the long run, purchase them using credit cards.
</font><p><font size="2">Unfortunately the I.T. industry here is kinda dying a natural death because of the economic climate we have. Computer hardware and software is just too expensive so a lot of companies are not really keen on updating their computer systems except for the financial sector which is the only thriving industry.
